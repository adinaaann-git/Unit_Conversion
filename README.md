In this code Streamlit application is designed to convert between different units of length and temperature.
The app provides an interactive user interface to input values and select units, making the conversion process
straightforward. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

. Length Conversion Function :

- The code imports streamlit, a framework that allows for easy creation of web applications using Python.
- This function converts between different length units: meters, kilometers, centimeters, inches, and feet.
- The units dictionary stores the conversion factors relative to meters.
- The input value is converted to meters first (value_in_meters) and then converted to the desired target
   unit (converted_value).

. Temperature Conversion Function :

- This function handles temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- It first checks if the from_unit and to_unit are the same; if so, it returns the input value
   as no conversion is necessary.
- then, it applies the appropriate formulas for converting between the various temperature scales.
